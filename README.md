# GiveWings — Open Source Launch Guide

# 🌍 GiveWings

## Transform Surplus Into Impact

GiveWings is a hyperlocal rescue and redistribution platform designed to reduce waste and maximize social impact.

The platform connects:

* Restaurants
* Event organizers
* Individuals
* NGOs
* Volunteers

through a real-time donation rescue ecosystem.

Instead of letting usable resources go to waste, GiveWings enables nearby organizations to discover, reserve, and collect donations efficiently.

* Impact-focused technology

The long-term vision is to evolve GiveWings into a multi-resource impact platform supporting:

✅ Waste diversion & CO₂ reduction tracking
✅ Volunteer logistics
✅ NGO operational routing
